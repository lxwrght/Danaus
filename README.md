In this activity, you will learn about monarch butterfly biology and how math models can help understand the many threats to their population. See how the monarch population may increase or decrease with a hands-on modeling experience, which allows you to adjust the amount of plant resources on the landscape, climate conditions, and other environmental variables. Watch the model results on your computer screen!

This activity was created strictly for educational purposes. It is NOT meant to make real-world predictions nor should it be used to inform management. Data on monarch abundance (1994-2016) were provided by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
