In this activity, you will learn about monarch butterfly biology and how math models can help understand the many threats to their population. See how the monarch population may increase or decrease with a hands-on modeling experience, which allows you to adjust the amount of plant resources on the landscape, climate conditions, and other environmental variables. Watch the model results on your computer screen!

This was created  as part of an activity for the 2018 Girls' Math & Science Day at Michigan State University led by the Zipkin Quantitative Ecology Lab.
